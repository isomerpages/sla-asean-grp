<h2>Gadjah Mada University</h2>
<h4>International Program of Geodetic Engineering </h4>
<p>The Department Geodetic Engineering (DGE) was established in 1959 and
has contributed significantly in educating geospatial professionals in
Indonesia and the region. It has produced more than 3000 alumni, positioning
the DGE as the biggest education entity in geodetic engineering in Indonesia.
Good quality education and a strong network with universities and industries
in Asia, Australia, America, Europe and Africa are the main reasons why
the International Undergraduate Program of Geodetic Engineering is a convincing
choice.</p>

<h4>Bachelor of Applied Science in Geographic Information System</h4>
<p>Bachelor of Applied Science in Geographic Information System (GIS) is
an applied study program of science, technology, and methods to solve problems
by integrating hardware and software for data acquisition, managing, analysing,
and presenting various type of geographic-referenced information. Our study
program prepares students to engage in GIS applications i.e. location-based
services, smart city, routing and logistic analysis, spatial planning,
disaster and environment, agriculture and plantation, etc. Diploma IV in
Geographic Information System is the pioneer in applied degree in Indonesia.</p>
