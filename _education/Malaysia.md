<h2>Universiti Putra Malaysia</h2>
<h4>Postgraduate Programme in Geographic Information System</h4>
<p>The postgraduate programme in Geographic Information System (GIS) focuses
on the integration of hardware, software for capturing, managing, manipulating,
analysing, and displaying all forms of geographically referenced information
(spatial) data and the utilisation of a GIS that reveals relationships.
This field covers GIS concepts including spatial data structures, data
sources and transfer methods, projections and coordinate systems, georeferencing,
metadata, supporting software, global positioning systems, the acquisition
and compilation of data from maps, field surveys, aerial photographs and
satellite images, the integration of remote sensing and GIS, as well as
fundamental and advanced spatial analysis techniques such as overlay, extraction,
and interpolation</p>
