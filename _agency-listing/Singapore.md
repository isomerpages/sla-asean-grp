<p>The <a href="https://www.sla.gov.sg/geospatial-development-and-services" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Singapore Land Authority</a> (SLA)
is the national geospatial agency of Singapore, with the objective to support
and encourage the adoption of Geospatial data, services and technologies
as part of the government’s move towards a Smart Nation.</p>
<p>A key initiative underpinning this objective is the Singapore Geospatial
Master Plan, which drives Singapore’s national geospatial development,
maximising the impact of geospatial information and technology for the
economy and the wider society.</p>
<p>The latest iteration, published in 2024, is co-driven by the SLA and the
Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA). It is a collaborative and
visionary undertaking, bringing together both the land and sea towards
transforming Singapore into ‘A Leading Global Geospatial Hub’.</p>
